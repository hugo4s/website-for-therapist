                Art Therapy makes it possible to express what is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to communicate with words. Using art creates the opportunity to delve into the unconscious and parts of the brain in which words do not exist. Art Therapy has a unique way of healing old wounds, and we believe in working with you, first and foremost, to find the path to wellness that is best for you.

                There is no “one size fits all” approach to therapy, and we love co-creating the therapeutic experience with you, whether or not that includes making art. The clinicians here at Alexandria Art Therapy are trained as art therapists and counselors. We’re skilled at helping clients determine what blend of art making or verbal processing meets their needs in therapy.
