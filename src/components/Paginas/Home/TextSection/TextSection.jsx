            At Alexandria Art Therapy, we dont expect you to have all the answers. 
            We know that stressful experiences are made even more stressful when we canâ€™t find the words to describe them. 
            Thats why we use art therapy and counseling to help you release, rewrite, and heal stories from the past. 
            The creative process lets you transcend traditional talk therapy to get right to the heart of the matter 
            and rediscover your own version of wellbeing.
